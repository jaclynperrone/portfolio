      p MLB came to Pivotal Labs in January with Oracle, their outdated customer service tool that was in desperate need of a redesign. Its bulky interface, confusing architecture and unintuitive workflow made it hard to train and retain agents. It also lead to many mistakes and an increase in call time that cost MLB millions of dollars a year.
      p In an effort to save money and make their agents more efficient, MLB came to us to rethink the way their customer service center operated across all their different product divisions.

  h2.section-title The kickoff
  .half-col 
    p We kickstarted the project with an inception and outlined the project vision, goals and risks. From there we mapped out a huge network of stakeholders and their roles within the organization. We used these exercises to prioritize which problems to solve first. 

    p Their WWE Network division was anticipating a high call volume in April for Wrestlemania, and were worried that Oracle would crash with the influx of new requests. Finding and pulling up customer information was the most important task, so we decided to start small and create a search tool for WWE call agents.

    .half-col 
      p Before we started the redesign, we took a trip down to Texas to see the customer service agents in action. We learned a ton through interviews and activities, and spent two days onsite observing agents as they answered calls and performed processes. We learned about their needs, motivations and pain points, as well as how they used (or didn't use!) Oracle to get their job done.

  h2.section-title Wireframing & Prototyping
  .half-col 
    p We returned to New York with a ton of information, and a much deeper understanding of a day in the life of a customer service agent. We went right to work and overhauled the current Oracle design and workflow through sketches and wireframes. 

    p After collaborating with MLB and collecting their feedback, we created an HTML prototype that surfaced and consolidated customer information and exposed account alerts. Most importantly, we implemented fuzzy search to replace the exact-match search in the Oracle system. Calls move quickly, and having flexible and forgiving search helps call agents find customers on the fly.

    .half-col 
      p We tested our prototype with remote agents in the Philippines and used their feedback to iterate on the workflow. With every testing session and iteration I started adding more and more visual design to get a feel for what worked and what didn't. I started out with a light color scheme, but eventually switched to a dark color scheme to help prevent eye strain for agents who would be looking at the application all day.

  h2.section-title The Launch
  .half-col 
    p The HTML and CSS for the prototype was rolled into the working application, and I maintained the codebase as I tested with agents, collaborated with developers and incorporated feedback. After about two months we were ready to launch the first iteration of the tool for agents to use during Wrestlemania.

    p In this first iteration, we focused on customer search and surfacing billing information, which were the two main reasons why agents used Oracle. Because of this, we successfully redirected most of the traffic from Oracle to our tool, which prevented Oracle from crashing. Crisis was averted and the client was so happy!

    .half-col 
      p In the days after the launch we set up screen-sharing sessions with agents to watch them use our app while taking calls. These insights, coupled with user interviews, resulted in more features and improvements lined up for the next phase of work. Now, six months later, the agents are still using our tool and it's amazing to see first-hand the impact we are making on their lives.
