  p These functional specs are for a pharmaceutical app that gets loaded on a seller's iPad. I sat down with copy writers and designers in the early stages and consulted on menu structure, interactions, content and user flow. The end result was a functional spec that outlined the behavior of the app for the developers. This was a tough one because it required a lot of planning and layout organization, in addition to putting complicated animations and transitions into words.
