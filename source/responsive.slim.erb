      p Ogilvy had just spent a year rebranding DuPont and redesigning their entire online presence. It's a behemoth of a catalog that features their products, industries, press kits and mission statements, all in multiple languages and countries. But soon after the design was finished, they realized that their website also needed to be optimized for mobile devices, and so they rehired Ogilvy to make it responsive. I was the lead UX designer on this project, and worked closely with the visual designer to translate their fixed site into a fluid layout.

    p We tackled each component piece by piece and decided how they would look and behave across different devices. I showcased these decisions as a series of 60+ high-fidelity responsive prototypes that range from full templates to individual modules. 

    p I built the prototypes from scratch using HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript in order to tailor them specifically to DuPont's needs. I then combined all of these prototypes into one hub that displays their behavior at every breakpoint, using iframes.

    p Dupont was the most expansive, challenging, and rewarding project I worked on at Ogilvy. It was a successful project that highlighted efficiency, transparency, and collaboration. The prototype hub made it easier for the client to share work across their various teams, and it kept everything in one place to reduce confusion. We also developed a close relationship with DuPont that was a departure from the usual agency/client rapport of show and tell. We set up bi-weekly working sessions with the DuPont team to tighten the feedback loop and immerse them into our design process and thinking. 

    p Our workflow helped lay a foundation for trust and respect. To this day, itâ€™s my frame of reference for a great working relationship with an enterprise client. Not only did it make DuPont very happy, but it also strengthened Ogilvy's confidence in its responsive design offerings. DuPont is rolling out our designs as we speak, and it's amazing to see all of our hard work come to life (across multiple devices!).
