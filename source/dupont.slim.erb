  p This is the most expansive project I've done so far at Ogilvy. I took DuPont's current static website and recreated it as a series of about 60 high-fidelity responsive prototypes that range from full templates to individual modules.  I built them from scratch using HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript in order to tailor them specifically to DuPont's needs. I combined all of these prototypes into one hub that displays their behavior at every breakpoint, starting at desktop and finishing with mobile.  This project took a year to complete, and not only did it make DuPont very happy, but it also allowed me and my UX team to take a big step forward in our responsive design offerings.
