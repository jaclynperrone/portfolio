  p TPI stands for Team Performance Index, and it is UPS's secret calculation that measures a sports team's efficiency.  They wanted to showcase this for college basketball's March Madness, so we brainstormed different ways to pull this off in a creative and engaging way. As the UX lead on this project, I funneled all of these ideas into a series of wireframes that depicted a simple and efficient layout and user flow.
