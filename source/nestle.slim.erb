    .project-desc Nestle wanted to celebrate their 75th Anniversary in Facebook-tab style, so they came to us with an idea for a bake-off between top bakeries all over the United States. After getting briefed, I created a wireframe that mapped out a simple layout with an index page displaying each bakery that clicks through to detail pages with recipes and bios. While the design and project was taking shape, I talked with developers about the voting mechanism and I helped them implement an intuitive user flow.
