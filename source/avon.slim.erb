    .project-desc When Avon came to us to redesign sellavon.com, I immediately raised my hand and said that it should be a long scroll, responsive site. I started working on wireframes right away with the idea of big bright images sprinkled throughout a page of easily-digestible content.  I also made a responsive prototype based off of these wires, to show the designer how images will scale. We passed ideas back and forth and I would test them with code to see if they would look good on a mobile device. The end result was a wonderful collaboration that created a beautiful site for a happy customer.
