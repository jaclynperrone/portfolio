      p I run the Design Critique sessions that take place every week in the Pivotal Labs NYC office.  It's a practice I adapted from the Labs design team in San Francisco. Critiques are hour long sessions set aside for two designers to present their client work and collect feedback from fresh eyes and fellow designers.  

      p As I ran and organized more of these sessions I noticed that certain things werenâ€™t going smoothly. In response, I revamped Critique to respond to the needs and pain points of the designers collecting feedback.

    p In its original form, the presenting designers would pin their mockups to the wall and the team would attach their comments on post-its. A facilitator would then read aloud everything written down, and the designer would leave critique with their mockups covered in post-it notes.

    p  A few problems quickly arose from this method. There was little time for discussion, lost time in translating stickies, and redundancy in reading comments aloud. There were also too many artifacts for the designer to collect and maintain, and post-its would lose their context if they fell off the mock-up.

      p I came up with a dot technique that addresses the problems presented by the post-its. Designers are handed index cards and a sheet of dots that they initial and number. They place their dots on the areas they would like to talk about and write down their corresponding notes on the index card. The dots create a heat-map that the facilitator uses to guide the discussion and call on people individually. At the end of the session, the presenting designer collects the dotted mockups and index cards and incorporates them into their next design iteration.

    p This new technique has proven to be very successful and other Pivotal Labs offices are adopting it. The artifacts are cleaner and hold context, there's more time for a fluid discussion, and everyone gets a chance to speak and participate. We also invite clients and outside designers into our sessions to show them our process and the importance of collecting feedback. Critique has a big influence on our design team, and I've really enjoyed making it a key part of our process.
