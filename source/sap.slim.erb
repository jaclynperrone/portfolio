    .project-desc SAP and NBA partnered to deliver their Playoff Facebook Quiz, which consists of 10 basketball questions per game, with varying difficulty levels. I sat down with the creative and account team early on and talked about requirements, potential issues, and an efficient user flow.  After a few rounds of design comps and client approval, I created these functional specs for the development team that cover the scoring algorithms, Facebook integration and overall expected behavior.
